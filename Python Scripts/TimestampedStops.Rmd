Notebook projecting the yearly storage of data given that timstamps for start and stop times are stored during the production of any given range. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
source("tidyStops.R")
tidy_Stops <- tidyStops()

# Use the period between July 2 of 2015 and 2016 for estimate base
yearStops <- tidy_Stops %>% filter(date > "2015-07-02" & date > "2016-07-02")

# Calculate total stops in production for time period
totalAnnualStops <- sum(yearStops$combinedstops)

# Set total stops of time period as length of projected dataframe; set columns to 11 for 
# projected fields to be stored
m <- matrix(1, nrow = totalAnnualStops, ncol = 11)
m <- as.data.frame(m)

# Set data types for columns
m[,1] <- sapply(m[,1], as.Date)
m[,2:4] <-  sapply(m[,2:4], as.factor)
m[,5:6] <- sapply(m[,5:6], as.Date.POSIXct)
m[,7:11] <- sapply(m[,7:11], as.integer)

# Projected size of records
print(object.size(m), units = "Mb")
```
