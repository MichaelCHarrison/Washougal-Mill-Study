Now with the df produced by mergedM365Stops(), i can look more deeply into performance on a number of given filter optons: range, millstyle, or loom.

For loom I could make...


542 is the highest performing range:

```{r}
library(ggplot2); library(lattice)

df542 <- mergedM365Stops(rangeno = 542)
qplot(millstyle, data = df542)
```
```{r}
summary_df542 <- df542 %>%
        group_by(millstyle) %>%
        summarise(perstop = (sum(totalyards)/sum(combinedstops))) %>%
        arrange(perstop) %>% #head of this are the best perfomring styles on the 542 
        print()


        
```

```{r}
tidy_yarns %>% 
        filter(millstyle == "972-19033-GRG")
```
